The following work still needs to be done:

Bluetooth:
  May need to find the port at runtime for the ESP32 bluetooth servers
  The python scripts that receive the bluetooth data currently write to the terminal that they are connected, I would like them to send data to the main program to inform it that the connection was successful

Heat/Humidity Sensors:
  Need to add variables to main to store the values
  Need to write a python code to read the GPIO pins the sensor is connected to and send the data to the main file
  OR Need to write a c++ function to read the GPIO pins.
    C++ solution removes need for other files and jobs
    Python solution allows use of a GPIO reading library. There may still be a c++ library to read them that I am unaware of
    
Drawing:
  Since I do not have the hardware yet to draw images to an LED matrix, I do not have any code to do so.
  Currently, the main program writes to the terminal which face is currently being drawn.
  The main program currently calls fork() and makes the child process draw. I do not know if drawing requires an exec call, so if it is not needed I can quickly update the code to simplify this.
